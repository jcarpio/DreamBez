3. Use of AI Models and Public Repositories

DreamBez, a project of Enkire OÜ, uses advanced artificial intelligence models to create personalized images for our users. These models, once trained, are hosted on public repositories such as Huggingface.com and Replicate.com. The purpose of using these repositories is to facilitate the generation of images as requested by users. However, by being hosted on public platforms, these models may be accessible to third parties.

Enkire OÜ is not responsible for any consequences resulting from third-party use or misuse of the models once they are made public. By using our services, you acknowledge and accept that the models, and any derivatives, may be accessed by others.

If you are concerned about third-party use of the models based on your uploaded images, we advise against using our service. Upon registering and using our service, you accept this risk and our privacy practices.

4. Request for Data and Model Deletion

Should a user wish to have their personal data and the AI models they contributed to deleted, Enkire OÜ offers the ability to request the removal of this data. Users can contact Enkire OÜ at support@enkire.com, and upon request, the user’s personal information and models will be deleted from public repositories within a maximum of 7 days. This action will ensure that the models are no longer available on platforms such as Huggingface or Replicate.

5. Sharing Your Information

We do not share your personal information with third parties except in the following circumstances:

	•	Service Providers: We may share your information with service providers who help us operate our platform (e.g., payment processors, hosting services).
	•	Public Repositories: The AI models we develop, including those that process your images, may be shared in public repositories like Huggingface and Replicate, as outlined above.
	•	Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information where we are required to comply with legal obligations, court orders, or government requests.
	•	Business Transfers: In the event of a business transfer, such as a merger or acquisition, we may share or transfer your personal data.
