Welcome to DreamBez, a project of Enkire OÜ (“Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). These terms and conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of our website, services, and products (collectively, “Services”). By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use our Services.

1. Introduction

Enkire OÜ is a digital services company based in Estonia, established on January 5, 2024 through Estonia’s e-Residency program. Our company is made up of a diverse, international team with members from different continents. Our vision is to continue expanding this multicultural team, promoting collaboration across borders.

DreamBez is an open-source project aimed at creating hyper-realistic images using FLUX LORA DEV models and generating Dream Albums based on these images. We work with advanced artificial intelligence technologies and store the models in open repositories such as Huggingface.com and Replicate.com.

Users who do not wish for their models to be accessible to others should not use this service, as the models created and used in DreamBez may be publicly available due to the open-source nature of these platforms.
